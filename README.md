## 1. **Project Description**

Ever wanted to create something new and unique in the kitchen, but needed a little inspiration or help with finding novel dinner ideas? It doesn't matter how much you love to cook, deciding what to have for dinner every day can feel like a chore. Moreover, scouring the internet for ideas can induce the paradox of choice and elicit feelings of anxiety at the overwhelming number of options available. Meal Planner takes this weight off your shoulders and makes the decisions for you, either by allowing you to choose which part of the meal you are craving, or if you're feeling **extra** spontaneous, curate a full-course dinner menu, all with the simple click of a few buttons.

Meal Planner is a web application that utilizes two external APIs (meal, drink API) in order to generate recipes for a full-course dinner menu. Additionally, the user is able to filter ingredients based on dietary restrictions/preferences to create a list of meals and assign them to each day of the week. If the user doesn't like the recipes presented, they can either generate a new recipe or, as a last resort, click a button that redirects them to the UberEats application.

## 3. **User Story**

- On the main landing page the user will find a description of the application and instructions on how to generate the customized meal or drink recipes. 

- Once the menu options are chosen, the user will have an additional option of filtering certain ingredients. Once finalized, the Meal Finder will make a fetch API call to generate recipes for that particular meal or drink search query.

- Once the submit button is clicked, the user will be presented with a display that contains details for the meal/drink recipe and ingredients. A new set of buttons will appear, giving the user options to: 
  1. Print the recipe for future reference
  2. Re-randomizing the output based on the prior set parameters, or
  3. Change selections by going back to the main landing page

- The user will also have the option of having different meal and drink options per day for the given week.

- This web application will hopefully help the user plan ahead, provide experience with new recipes and/or drinks, while assisting them with organizing it all for the upcoming week.

## 5. **Challenges**

- Finding suitable APIs to match our desired functionality and output

- Creating the functions to filter by ingredients

- Including the different recipes within the date tabs for the weekly planner

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## 6. **Direction for Future Development**

- Adding a price function to assist with budgeting and managing costs
- Creating a function to save the recipes locally instead of printing the page for future reference
- Further optimizing the web design and adding additional styling elements for a better UI experience
- Utilizing the Uber Eats API to add improved functionality to the Feelin' Lazy button
- Integrating a video link (e.g. YouTube) as an additional guide
